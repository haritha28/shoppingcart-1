      <p>INSTALLATION</p>

<p>Install ‘LAMP’ server in Linux or ‘WAMP’ server in Windows.
We can also install Apache, MySql and PHP individually.</p>

<p>CREATION OF TABLES</p>

<p>Before creating tables in ‘mysql’, an exclusive ‘user’ and ‘database’ must be created for shopping cart.
Initially, the ‘username’ will be ‘root’. We can create the username and password and grant all privileges to that ‘username’ by logging with root user.
Create the tables required for designing a shopping cart.</p>

<p>CREATION OF MAIN PAGE</p>

<p>In the folder ‘WWW’, we can find a file named ‘index.html’ or ‘default.html’ or with extensions ‘.php’. If file is not present, create a file named ‘index.php’.
The html, css, php and sql codes can be written in that file.
It is better to create different files for the css, javascript and html with php in the shopping cart. We can link the files to ‘index.php’.
We need to open the connection to Mysql database before executing any sql queries, and the same connection is to be closed after work is completed.</p>
