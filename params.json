We can create the username and password and grant all privileges to that ‘username’ by logging with root user.\r\nCreate the tables required for designing a shopping cart.\r\n\r\nCREATION OF MAIN PAGE\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn the folder ‘WWW’, we can find a file named ‘index.html’ or ‘default.html’ or with extensions ‘.php’. If file is not present, create a file named ‘index.php’.\r\nThe html, css, php and sql codes can be written in that file.\r\nIt is better to create different files for the css, javascript and html with php in the shopping cart. We can link the files to ‘index.php’.\r\nWe need to open the connection to Mysql database before executing any sql queries, and the same connection is to be closed after work is completed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
